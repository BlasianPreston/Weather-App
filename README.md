# Weather-App
I created a weather app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also utilized the OpenWeatherMap API to get accurate measurements of the weather. Enter the city name and click the search icon and it will display the temp, weather type, wind speed, and humidity of the city in imperial units.
